ShareMint: Decentralized Image-Sharing App
ShareMint is a decentralized image-sharing application that leverages Blockchain Technology to provide users with a secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer image-sharing experience. This project combines the power of IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain to ensure data integrity and immutability, allowing users to share images with confidence.

Features
Decentralized Image Sharing: ShareMint enables users to share images in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for a centralized authority and enhancing security.

IPFS Integration: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used for storing and retrieving images. This ensures that images are distributed across a network of nodes, making the system resilient and censorship-resistant.

Ethereum Blockchain Transactions: The Ethereum blockchain is utilized to record and verify image transactions, providing a transparent and immutable ledger. This ensures the integrity of the shared images.

ethers.js Integration: Interaction with the Ethereum blockchain is facilitated by ethers.js, a powerful JavaScript library for working with Ethereum. ShareMint leverages ethers.js to perform efficient and secure transactions on the blockchain.

User-Friendly Interface: The application is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, to provide users with an intuitive and seamless experience.

Smart Contracts with Solidity: The smart contracts, responsible for managing image transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, are implemented in Solidity, a language specifically designed for smart contract development.

Pinata API: ShareMint integrates with the Pinata API for managing IPFS content, ensuring robust file management on the IPFS network.

Hardhat Development Environment: The development environment is set up using Hardhat, a popular tool for compiling, deploying, and testing Ethereum smart contracts.
